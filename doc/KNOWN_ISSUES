* stat of directories is non-deterministic: Directories (as
  containers) are shared outputs between all targets that create files
  in them. Thus, "stat" on them is either non-deterministic, or forces
  a total order on all file creators in the directory. buildsome
  chooses the former.

* symlinks not handled correctly yet.

* any out-of-band access (to /dev, /proc, /tmp or the socket API for
  that matter) is untracked and can inject any amount of
  non-determinism into the build process.

* link count is ignored in stats (can cause false positives if any
  third party even opens a file/dir, and unlikely to be used as
  legitimate input of a build process)
