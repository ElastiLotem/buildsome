Thread model:

main thread -> withAsync
  server thread -> accept
    connection thread -> need(async)
      slave execution

RW files:

* Sandbox all /tmp files so only same process sees them

* Delete all output files before executing cmd, so they are safe to
  open r+w

* Notify open for W when opening for R+W

* If unspecified output file is opened (for R+W), it will thus error
  on the master side

Deletions:

* Deletes should always be of explicitly declared output files.
