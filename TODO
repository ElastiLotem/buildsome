* (UNIQUE_KEY(Path), mtime, chash) -- path queries/updates

  * When to GC this? When the path is deleted

* Delete outputs when they are no longer defined by the Makefile,
  regardless of whether they're in the build now?

  * What about dynamically generated outputs?

* Execution log: (UNIQUE_KEY(CMD), [(InputFileName, InputCHash)], [(OutputFileName, OutputCHash)])

----------------------

* Need to have the semaphore wait scheduler prefer waiters that are
  being waited for by many dependents, over waiters that just want to
  spawn new commands.  i.e: Prefer to finish stuff than start stuff

  * There are only 2 interesting priorities: Normal (needed by hints),
    FSHook (needed by a memory-consuming process). We could have more
    fine grained priorities by measuring how much resources are held
    in memory.
