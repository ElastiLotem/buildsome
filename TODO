* Local database in sqlite?

  * TABLE MTimeContents:

    path    mtime    sha1

    TABLE ExecutionLogCmds:

    ID cmdline

    TABLE ExecutionLogInputs
    ID outputpath (many) inputpaths
    

* Need to have the semaphore wait scheduler prefer waiters that are
  being waited for by many dependents, over waiters that just want to
  spawn new commands.  i.e: Prefer to finish stuff than start stuff

  * There are only 2 interesting priorities: Normal (needed by hints),
    FSHook (needed by a memory-consuming process). We could have more
    fine grained priorities by measuring how much resources are held
    in memory.
