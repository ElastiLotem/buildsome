* "Concurrent" identifiers for each concurrent command (even paused ones)
  * Indentation is based on this

* "Parallel" identifiers for actual allocated parallelism,
  illustrating actual use of parallelism
  * Record this to figure out actual achieved parallelism

* Need to prefer scheduling waiters that are being waited for by many
  online dependents, over waiters that just want to spawn new
  commands.  i.e: Prefer to finish stuff than start stuff

  * There are only 2 interesting priorities: Normal (needed by hints),
    FSHook (needed by a memory-consuming process). We could have more
    fine grained priorities by measuring how much resources are held
    in memory.
