* Meta-variable expansions as an extra pass on cmds, before executing
  the cmd, and not during parsing

* Patterns need to support multiple outputs

* {} bash expansions in Makefile

* Paths relative/absolute/etc?

* Allow output files if they do not exist before and are unlinked
  after
  * Need to ban access to these files while they do exist
  * This can replace the /tmp exception

* Subdir-recursive pattern rules?

* Enumerate pattern outputs (wildcards, container dir of patterns)
