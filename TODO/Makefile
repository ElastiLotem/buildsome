"leaked" stuff to be per all cmds, not per cmd

* Patterns need to support multiple outputs

* Paths relative/absolute/etc?

* Allow output files if they do not exist before and are unlinked
  after
  * Need to ban access to these files while they do exist
  * This can replace the /tmp exception

* Subdir-recursive pattern rules?

* Enumerate pattern outputs (wildcards, container dir of patterns)
