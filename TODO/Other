* CWD should always be set to the Makefile itself, so everything
  should be relative to the Makefile

* Scan upwards for Makefile at root to use with curdir as parameter by default

* Bugs:
  * Wrong FS input model:
    * mode-only-inputs, (rely on mode only)
      content-only-inputs (rely on content + dirchildren but not on the stat),
      full-inputs (rely on stat + content + dirchildren)

    * When file is symlink, everything except lstat/readlink need to
      have an input dependency on the link content AND the file behind
      it

    * Only report *successful* outputs? Or perhaps report as inputs,
      output operations that failed due to FS state?


* C-side can be given allowed outputs rules and fail anything else

  * Need C side to verify output files do not exist before-hand to
    avoid covert channels that are then unlinked

* C-side can be given buildable outputs and not round-trip for other inputs

* Use mtime cache to see that outputs already match the execution log too

* Add an age to keys, and delete old ones?

* C side failures should send fail messages to server, which is the
  only way to fail the job reliably
