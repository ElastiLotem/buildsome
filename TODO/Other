* Features:
  * .gitignore
  * replay stdout/stderr

* Bugs:
  * Missing verification about used targets/etc when using execution log?
  * Wrong FS input model:
    * mode-only-inputs, (rely on mode only)
      content-only-inputs (rely on content + dirchildren but not on the stat),
      full-inputs (rely on stat + content + dirchildren)

    * When file is symlink, everything except lstat/readlink need to
      have an input dependency on the link content AND the file behind
      it

* Refactoring:
  * Extract an abstract HookedFileSystem module that runs the server,
    and has a: makeEnv that generates a job id that the server responds
    to, and gives the needed env vars to add.

* Only report *successful* outputs? Or perhaps report as inputs,
  output operations that failed due to FS state?

* C-side can be given allowed outputs rules and fail anything else

  * Need C side to verify output files do not exist before-hand to
    avoid covert channels that are then unlinked

* C-side can be given buildable outputs and not round-trip for other inputs

* Use mtime cache to see that outputs already match the execution log too

* Add an age to keys, and delete old ones?

* C side failures should send fail messages to server, which is the
  only way to fail the job reliably
