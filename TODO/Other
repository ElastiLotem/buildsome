* Extract an abstract HookedFileSystem module that runs the server,
  and has a: makeEnv that generates a job id that the server responds
  to, and gives the needed env vars to add.

* Verification about used targets/etc, also when using execution log
* replay stdout/stderr

* Only report *successful* outputs? Or perhaps report as inputs,
  output operations that failed due to FS state?

* C-side can be given allowed outputs rules and fail anything else

  * Need C side to verify output files do not exist before-hand to
    avoid covert channels that are then unlinked

* C-side can be given buildable outputs and not round-trip for other inputs

* Use mtime cache to see that outputs already match the execution log too

* Add an age to keys, and delete old ones?

* C side failures should send fail messages to server, which is the
  only way to fail the job reliably
