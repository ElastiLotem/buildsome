* Verification about used targets/etc, also when using execution log
* replay stdout/stderr

* C-side can be given allowed outputs rules and fail anything else
* C-side can be given buildable outputs and not round-trip for other inputs

* Use mtime cache to see that outputs already match the execution log too

* Add an age to keys, and delete old ones?
